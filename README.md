# Simple obfuscation assembly program

## Intro:  
This program obfuscates the string "hello world" by doing XOR operation with certain value.  

After the obfuscation, the obfuscated string is recovered back to original string "hello world"  
by repeating XOR operaion with the same value that we used to obfuscate.

## Working environment:
- VMware Workstaion 12 Player
- Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
- gdb-7.7.1
